  * select CLOBs

henplus (0.9.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * do a workaround for a bug in hsqldb (exiting does not work properly)
  * rename the commands 'set' and 'unset' to 'set-var' and 'unset-var'
    because these are probably common commands provided by databases
  * rename session only, if a session with the given name does not already
    exist
  * add password-erase-while-typing hack.
  * make removing of comments switchable. Oracle for instance conveys
    hints in comments.
