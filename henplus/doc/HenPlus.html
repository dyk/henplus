<h3>Overview</h3>
HenPlus is a SQL shell that works for any database that has JDBC support. So
basically any database. Why do we need this ? Any database comes with some
shell, but all of them have missing features (and several are simply unusable).
And if you work with several
databases at once (if you are a developer, then you do this all the time),
then switching between these tools is tedious.
<p>
This is where <em>HenPlus</em> steps in. It supports:
<ul>
 <li>Any JDBC aware database.</li>
 <li>Has commandline completion for commands and tables / columns
     within SQL-commands. IMHO its much better than the command completion
     provided by the mysql or pgsql (PostgreSQL) tools.</li>
 <li>Multiple open connection-sessions can be handled in parallel. You can just
     switch between them. So you can be connected to different databases to
     experiemnt with the same statement in all of them, for example.<br>
     All JDBC-Urls of opened sessions are stored for
     later command line completion in the <code>connect</code> command.</li>
 <li>Command line history</li>
 <li>A <code>describe</code> command for database tables, that work all
     JDBC-Drivers that unveil the appropriate MetaData.</li>
 <li>supports variables (with commandline completion of their names)</li>
 <li>loading files</li>
 <li>supports some built-in commands (<code>start</code>, <code>@</code>,
     <code>@@</code>, <code>spool</code>) and
     syntax from the SQL-plus utility (like the single '/' on a line
     to close a statement). Most SQL-plus scripts will run directly, so
     its simple to switch to HenPlus.</li>
 <li>allows to store the commandline history, variables and connections
     per project</li>
</ul>

<h3>Getting started</h3>
compile, requires java-readline 0.7.3
; help command
<h3>Getting connected</h3>
drivers - classpath.
; connnect command / login
; ctrl-d disconnect.

<h3>Multiple connections</h3>
switch command.

<h3>Commandline completion</h3>
tables, columns in selects. tables in describe command (with correction)

<h3>Handling multiple projects</h3>
<em>HenPlus</em> stores the commandline history, the connection-URLs and
the variable settings persistently in the filesystem. This is written
to a a directory <code>~/.henplus</code>, that is createted in your
home directory.
<p>
If you have multiple projects you work on, this information might clobber
up, since <em>HenPlus</em> remembers all the connection URLs and settings you
use in any of these projects. Therefore <em>HenPlus</em> supports per project
storage of this information.
<p>
To store only information you use in some project, just create an empty 
<code>.henplus</code> directory in the directory you usually start the
<em>HenPlus</em> utility -- then <em>HenPlus</em> will use this directory to
store its configuration. More, if it does not find the <code>.henplus</code>
directory within the current working dir, it goes up the directory tree
until it finds the <code>.henplus</code> directory. If it still does
not find the directory, it falls back to the <code>~/.henplus</code> in your
home directory.
<p>
If you type 'help', then <em>HenPlus</em> tells you, where it loaded its
initial configuration from.


<h3>Im- and Export</h3>
The import and export of SQL-tables is not yet supported ;-). I am thinking of
some XML-format. Anyone wants to implement this ?
